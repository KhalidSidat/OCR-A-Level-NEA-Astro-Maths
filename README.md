# OCR-A-Level-NEA-Astro-Maths

A browser based educational math game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was created as part of an OCR A-Level NEA project to demonstrate my skills in web development and interactive game design.

About the game

My Astro Maths game challenges players to survive a 5-minute session or as long as they can solving maths equations while navigating through an interactive space environment.  
This project helped me learn and apply core web technologies and practice game logic using JavaScript.

Programming Languages used:

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

---------------

Demo:

- Access the game by opening index.html in a web browser

---------------

Game Features:

- Countdown timer (5 minutes)
- Incremental timer (Survival Mode) 
- Interactive gameplay  
- Maths-based survival mechanics  
- Styled interface with CSS  
- Multiple HTML game screens for different modes and end displays (start, game, victory, game over)

Future of the game:

I hope to increase the difficulty of the game and make it more entertaining for the younger audience possibly through implementing new design features.
